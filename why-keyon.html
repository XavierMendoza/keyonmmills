  <h2>Advantages Keyon Has That Others Might Miss</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <strong>A. Unique Background & Football IQ</strong><br /><br />
    QB lineage and upbringing in football: Most recruits do not have a parent who is a coach
    or personal quarterback experience themselves. This provides Keyon with an exceptional
    understanding of offensive schemes and the ability to anticipate plays as a safety.
    This allows him to read quarterbacks, recognize route concepts, and help direct the
    secondary. This is a coachable advantage that does not always appear in box scores
    or surface-level recruiting metrics.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <strong>B. Early College Experience</strong><br /><br />
    Keyon is already a true freshman starter at a Division III program, demonstrating
    his ability to handle college-level speed, physicality, and complexity.
    He already possesses game film against older and more physically mature players,
    which many high school-only recruits do not have entering the transfer process.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <strong>C. Measurables & Athleticism</strong><br /><br />
    Speed in the 4.48–4.51 range, strength numbers including a 315 bench and 425 squat,
    and strong agility metrics place Keyon above average for defensive backs and safeties.
    These measurables make him physically competitive at the Division II and FCS levels
    and potentially viable at the Division I level. Testimonials consistently highlight
    his first-step explosiveness, which many coaches value as highly as top-end speed.
