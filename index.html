  <!-- ================= PERSONAL STATEMENT ================= -->
 <section class="section">
  <h2>Immediate Transfer & Mid-Year Enrollment</h2>

  <p>
    Keyon Mills is immediately available for transfer and is academically and athletically
    prepared to enroll and compete beginning the second semester in January. Under current
    Division III transfer guidelines, Keyon does not require transfer-portal entry and can
    transition to a higher-level program without delay, making him an ideal option for staffs
    seeking instant roster help.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the field, Keyon offers positional versatility and immediate impact value. He can
    contribute at Free Safety, Strong Safety, Nickel, or as a Box Safety, providing defensive
    flexibility and depth across the secondary. His instincts, speed, and football IQ allow
    him to assimilate quickly into complex defensive schemes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Keyon should be viewed as:
  </p>

  <ul class="resume-list">
    <li>An immediate defensive contributor</li>
    <li>A special teams difference-maker</li>
    <li>A hybrid defensive back capable of filling multiple roles from Day One</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For programs needing a ready-to-play defensive back entering the spring semester,
    Keyon represents a rare combination of availability, versatility, and immediate
    competitiveness.

  <h2>Coach Testimonials</h2>

  <div class="testimonial-container">
    <blockquote class="testimonial active">
      As Keyon’s position coach, I watched him grow significantly throughout his freshman season.
      He plays like a centerfielder, with rare instincts and a natural feel for the football.
      His confidence and physicality improved weekly, showing flashes of violent tackling
      and continued upside as a downhill, impact safety.
      <span>— Position Coach</span>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="testimonial">
      I’ve had the privilege of training Keyon since he was 10 years old, and from the moment
      he walked into Above the Rest Academy, it was evident he was built differently.
      His relentless work ethic, elite first-step quickness, and commitment to mastering his craft
      separate him from the competition. Any program bringing him in will be getting a gifted athlete
      with consistency, character, and an unwavering drive to excel.
      <span>— Above the Rest Academy</span>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="testimonial">
      I’ve had the privilege of working with Keyon as both his coach and defensive back trainer.
      His ball skills were outstanding early on, and his football IQ grew rapidly as he transitioned
      to safety. He consistently applied coaching with professionalism and precision.
      Keyon is only scratching the surface of his potential as a high-impact defensive back.
      <span>— Arness Ikner, DB Specialist & Consultant</span>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="testimonial">
      Over a focused 16-week speed and performance cycle, Keyon showed excellent progress.
      His explosiveness, balance, and body control improved significantly through disciplined,
      intentional training. He trained with consistency and detail throughout the program,
      and I look forward to his continued production at the next level.
      <span>— Speed University</span>
